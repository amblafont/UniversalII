\begin{abstract}
  Inductive-inductive types (IITs) are a generalisation of inductive types in
  type theory. They allow the mutual definition of types with multiple sorts
  where later sorts can be indexed by previous ones. An example is the James
  Chapman-style syntax of type theory with conversion relations for each sort
  where e.g.\ the sort of types is indexed by contexts. It follows from previous
  work that all finitary IITs can be constructed from a quotient
  inductive-inductive type (QIIT), namely the theory of IIT signatures. This is
  a small domain-specific type theory where a context is a signature for an
  IIT. In this paper we construct this theory using only inductive types,
  thereby showing a reduction of all finitary IITs to inductive types.  We rely
  on function extensionality and uniqueness of identity proofs. We formalised
  the construction of the theory of IIT signatures in Agda.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\todo{Note by Ambrus: to be beautified, I only wanted to add the line of
  thought.}

\todo{András: overall todos: introduction, section 2 examples, intro to section 3, future work finish, maybe changing big Sigma notation to (x : A) x B notation (or changing the other way?)n}

\todo{
  András: construction of infinitary IITs doesn't (yet) work. Should we drop
  infinitary functions from signatures?
  }

Most mutual inductive types (e.g.\ isEven-isOdd) can be reduced to indexed
inductive types where the index gives the information which sort we
meant. (Indexed inductive types can be reduced to inductive types using a method
similar to what we use here, preterms and well-formedness predicate.)
Inductive-inductive types (IITs \cite{forsberg-phd}) allow the mutual definition
of a type and a family of types over the first one. The above reduction does not
work anymore.

Examples of IITs: Con-Ty is the minimal interesting one, then we have
James Chapman style \cite{chapman09eatitself} well-typed syntax for
type theory.

TODO: list examples here and explain. Also the elimination principles
which is recursive-recursive. Talk about connection to setoidified
CwFs (I think these are explained in some Dybjer paper) and maybe the
initiality conjecture.

Reduction of IITs to inductive types is an open problem. Forsberg
showed that IITs can be reduced to inductive types in the setting of
ETT, but he only constructed the nondependent (or simple? was this the
non-recursive-recursive?) elimination principle. Hugunin \cite{jasper}
reduced an example IIT to inductive types without UIP, but also only
constructing the non-recursive-recursive eliminator. Streicher
\cite{streichersemantics}. Brunerie \cite{} constructed the initial
category with extra structure (TODO: fix this) using UIP.

Kaposi and Kov{\'a}cs defined a type theory of signatures for higher
inductive-inductive types (HIITs)
\cite{kaposi_et_al:LIPIcs:2018:9190}. This is a small type theory in
which every context encodes a valid IIT signature. For example, the
signature for natural numbers is simply the context
$(Nat:\U,zero:Nat,suc:Nat\ra Nat)$ of length three ($Nat$, $zero$ and
$suc$ are simply variable names). Later they showed
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} that if a subset of this theory
of signatures exists, then any finitary QIIT can be defined from
it. In this paper we further restrict the subset by not allowing
equality constructors (thus only covering IITs) but at the same time
we extend it to allow infinitary constructors. To derive the existence
of all IITs from the theory of IIT signatures we use a variant of the
CwF model \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} where types are
modelled not by displayed CwFs but by CwF isofibrations. We need this
extension to support infinitary constructors. Furthermore, using the
method introduced by Streicher \cite{streichersemantics} we show the
existence of the theory of IIT signatures. As opposed to Streicher, we
don't use quotients in this construction as the theory of IIT
signatures can be given only using neutral terms.

Our metatheory is ETT. Using Hofmann \cite{}, Theo \cite{} translation
we can translate our arguments to ITT+UIP+funext. Section
\ref{sec:ambroise} was formalised in Agda using UIP, rewrite rules and
funext.

This is the paper version of our TYPES 2019 talk.

\subsection{Related Work}

Reduction of classes of inductive types: reduce indexed W-types to
W-types. IR types to indexed types. IITs were introduced by
Forsberg. What he did.  QIITs by Forsberg-lots of people. Our QIIT
paper. Jakob TYPES 2019 abstract.  Jasper Huguin: he didn't do
recursion-recursion. Without UIP.

Similar techique for other type theories: Streicher. Initiality
project, Brunerie. These all use quotients. Closest: Lafont TYPES
abstract 2017. Does not use quotients.

Constructing intrinsic syntax but different techniques: Chapman,
Danielsson, Nuo. These use induction-induction which is our goal.

\subsection{Structure of the Paper}

We first define a \emph{theory of IIT signatures} in which every context is a
valid IIT signature (Section \ref{sec:theory_of_signatures}). We present this
type theory as an algebraic \cite{ttintt} theory, specifically as a quotient
inductive-inductive type (QIIT). In Section \ref{sec:ambroise} we show that this
QIIT can be constructed only using inductive types. In Section
\ref{sec:constructingiits} we describe the construction of IITs from the syntax
of IIT signatures.

\subsection{Formalisation}

\section{Constructing the Theory of IIT Signatures}
\label{sec:ambroise}

\todo{Write this section}

Show that the theory of IIT signatures as described in Section
\ref{sec:theory_of_signatures} exists, that is, it can be defined only
using indexed inductive types and a $\Prop$ sort.

Ambroise has done this in Agda with funext and UIP using an
extrinsic--intrinsic translation.

Ambroise formalisation: \url{https://github.com/amblafont/UniversalII/tree/cwf-syntax/Cwf}.

In this formalization, there is a discrepancy for the typing rule of application
compared to the one of Section~\ref{sec:theory_of_signatures}: it is not
\[
   \app  : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\Pi\,a\,B)\ra\Tm\,(\Gamma\ext \El\,a)\,B
\]
but
\[
   \app  : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\Pi\,a\,B)\ra(u : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,a))\ra\,\Tm\,\Gamma\,B[<u>].
\]
Actually, I started with the first version, but at some point I
changed for the second one because it made some stuff easier (although
I don't remember exactly what it was).

I think this should be doable with only UIP (or a $\Prop$-valued
equality type?) and not funext. This would be important for a
computational justification of IITs.

Unfortunately, it seems that funext is needed (see the use of funext in
Syntax.agda) for the metatheoretic/infinitary
parameters part (4-5), for example in the case of the metatheoretic
$ \Pim  : (T:\Set)\ra(T\ra\Ty\,\Gamma)\ra\Ty\,\Gamma $. This needs to be
investigated more carefully.

\section{Constructing IITs from the Theory of IIT Signatures}
\label{sec:constructingiits}

We construct all IITs describable by the theory of IIT signatures through the
term model construction of \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315}. There, it is
shown that from the syntax of the theory of signatures for finitary QIITs, one
can construct any particular finitary QIIT. The idea is that for a signature
$\Gamma$, the initial algebra can be built from sets of terms of the form
$\Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,a)$. For example, taking the signature of natural numbers:
\[
  \Gamma := \cdot\,\ext\,N:\U\,\ext\,z : \El\,N\,\ext\,s : N \ra \El\,N
\]
we have that $\Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,N)$ is the set of natural numbers up to isomorphism,
since the only way to construct these terms is by using $s$ and $z$ from $\Gamma$.

In this section, we only need to check that the signatures and term model
construction in \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} restrict to IITs,
i.e.\ that from a syntax for the theory of IIT signatures all finitary IITs are
constructible.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Finitary IIT signatures are obtained exactly by dropping equality constructors from
  finitary QIIT signatures. It follows that any model for the theory of QIIT signatures
  restricts to IITs, hence we inherit the categorical semantics of QIITs.
\item
  The term model construction also restricts in a straightforward way. For QIITs,
  term algebras are constructed by induction on the syntax of signatures, and
  then another induction constructs the eliminator (i.e.\ dependent induction
  principle). In both cases, simply dropping equality constructors from the
  induction yields restriction to IITs.
\end{enumerate}

However, we shall mention that the Agda formalisation for the current paper
cannot be directly plugged into the Agda code for
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} (which includes most of the term model
construction). One reason is that the QIIT formalisation uses strict computation
rules for induction over signatures, while here we show propositional
computation. This mismatch can be in principle remedied by noting that both
formalisations use UIP and function extensionality, hence we can switch between
strict and propositional equalities, via the known translations between
extensional and intensional type
theories\cite{hofmann95extensional,winterhalter2019eliminating}.

Also, the current paper proves initiality, i.e.\ unique recursion for
signatures, while \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} uses dependent
elimination. We expect that the two notions are equivalent. An extension of
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} to large infinitary QIITs would entail
this equivalence, since that would cover the (large, infinitary) theory of IIT
signatures.


\section{Further Work}

\subsection{Infinitary IITs}.

The current work only concerns finitary IITs. An extension would be to also
allow infinitely branching inductive types such as W-types. This would first
require giving semantics for infinitary IITs (to our knowledge there is no
previously published semantics that we can borrow), and also giving a term model
construction analogously to finitary QIITs. These steps seem feasible. However,
it seems to be more difficult to construct the syntax of infinitary IIT
signatures without using quotients. The reason is that such syntax would not be
strictly restricted to neutral terms: we would need $\lambda$-abstraction and
$\beta\eta$-rules for infinitary $\Pi$ types, in order to allow a term model
construction for infinitary IITs. A definition for normal preterms and typing
judgments on them may still be possible, but it appears to be much more
complicated than before (the current authors have attempted this without
conclusive success).
