\begin{abstract}
  Inductive-inductive types (IITs) are a generalisation of inductive types in
  type theory. They allow the mutual definition of types with multiple sorts
  where later sorts can be indexed by previous ones. An example is the James
  Chapman-style syntax of type theory with conversion relations for each sort
  where e.g.\ the sort of types is indexed by contexts. It follows from previous
  work that all finitary IITs can be constructed from a quotient
  inductive-inductive type (QIIT), namely the theory of IIT signatures. This is
  a small domain-specific type theory where a context is a signature for an
  IIT. In this paper we construct the theory of IIT signatures using only inductive types,
  thereby showing a reduction of all finitary IITs to inductive types.  We rely
  on function extensionality and uniqueness of identity proofs. We formalised
  the construction of the theory of IIT signatures in Agda.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Many mutual inductive types can be reduced to indexed inductive types, where the
index disambiguates different sorts. An example is the predicates
$\mathsf{isEven}$ and $\mathsf{isOdd}$ defined mutually by the following
constructors.
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \mathsf{isEven} && : \N\ra\Set \\
  & \mathsf{isOdd} && : \N\ra \Set \\
  & \mathsf{zeroEven} && : \mathsf{isEven}\,\mathsf{zero} \\
  & \mathsf{sucEven} && : (n:\N)\ra\mathsf{isOdd}\,n\ra\mathsf{isEven}\,n \\
  & \mathsf{sucOdd} && : (n:\N)\ra\mathsf{isEven}\,n\ra\mathsf{isOdd}\,n
\end{alignat*}
These can be reduced to the following single inductive family.
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \mathsf{isEven?} && : \mathsf{Bool}\ra\N\ra\Set \\
  & \mathsf{zeroEven} && : \mathsf{isEven?}\,\mathsf{true}\,\mathsf{zero} \\
  & \mathsf{sucEven} && : (n:\N)\ra\mathsf{isEven?}\,\mathsf{false}\,n\ra\mathsf{isEven?}\,\mathsf{true}\,n \\
  & \mathsf{sucOdd} && : (n:\N)\ra\mathsf{isEven?}\,\mathsf{true}\,n\ra\mathsf{isEven?}\,\mathsf{false}\,n
\end{alignat*}

Inductive-inductive types (IITs \cite{forsberg-phd}) allow the mutual
definition of a type and a family of types over the first one. IITs
were originally introduced to represent the well-typed syntax of type
theory itself, and the main example is still the Chapman-style
\cite{chapman09eatitself} syntax for a type theory. A minimal use case
is the IIT of contexts and types given by the following constructors.
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \Con && : \Set \\
  & \Ty && : \Con\ra\Set \\
  & \mathsf{empty} && : \Con \\
  & \mathsf{ext} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,\Gamma\ra\Con \\
  & \mathsf{U} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,\Gamma \\
  & \mathsf{El} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,(\mathsf{ext}\,\Gamma\,(\mathsf{U}\,\Gamma))
%  & \mathsf{Pi} && : (\Gamma:\Con)(A:\Ty\,\Gamma)\ra\Ty\,(\mathsf{ext}\,\Gamma\,A)\ra\,\Ty\,\Gamma
\end{alignat*}
This type has two sorts, $\Con$ and $\Ty$. The $\mathsf{ext}$
constructor of $\Con$ refers to $\Ty$ and the $\Ty$-constructor
$\mathsf{U}$ refers to $\Con$, hence the two sorts have to be defined
at the same time. Moreover, $\Ty$ is indexed over $\Con$, which
precludes the above reduction which worked for
$\mathsf{isEven}$--$\mathsf{isOdd}$, as we would get a type indexed
over itself. Another unique feature of IITs (which also shows up in
higher inductive types \cite{HoTTbook}) is that later constructors can
refer to previous constructors: in our case, $\mathsf{El}$ mentions
$\mathsf{ext}$.
% \[
%   \mathsf{Con?} : (b:\mathsf{Bool})\ra\mathsf{if}\,b\,\mathsf{then}\,\Set\,\mathsf{else}\,(\mathsf{Con?}\,\mathsf{false}\ra\Set),
% \]

The elimination principle for the above IIT has two motives and one method
for each constructor. It is an example of a \emph{recursive-recursive}
function (following the nomenclature of \cite{forsberg-phd}) which
means that there are two mutually defined functions, where the type of
the second function depends on the first function. The proof assistant
Agda \cite{norell07thesis} allows the definition of such functions
(even from non-IITs) and it is also currently the only proof assistant
supporting IITs. The elimination principle for $\Con$--$\Ty$ says that
given the following components,
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & Con^M && : \Con\ra\Set \\
  & Ty^M && : Con^M\,\Gamma\ra\Ty\,\Gamma\ra\Set \\
  & empty^M && : Con^M\,\mathsf{empty} \\
  & ext^M && : (\Gamma^M:Con^M\,\Gamma)\ra Ty^M\,\Gamma^M\,A\ra Con^M\,(\mathsf{ext}\,\Gamma\,A) \\
  & U^M && : (\Gamma^M:Con^M\,\Gamma)\ra Ty^M\,\Gamma^M\,(\mathsf{U}\,\Gamma) \\
  & El^M && : (\Gamma^M:Con^M\,\Gamma)\ra\,Ty^M\,(ext^M\,\Gamma^M\,(U^M\,\Gamma^M))\,(\mathsf{El}\,\Gamma)
%  & Pi^M && : (\Gamma^M:Con^M\,\Gamma)(A^M:Ty^M\,\Gamma^M\,A)\ra Ty^M\,(ext^M\,\Gamma^M\,A^M)\ra\,Ty^M\,\Gamma^M\,(\mathsf{Pi}\,\Gamma\,A\,B)
\end{alignat*}
we obtain two functions
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \mathsf{elimCon} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra Con^M\,\Gamma \\
  & \mathsf{elimTy} && : (A:\Ty\,\Gamma)\ra Ty^M\,(\mathsf{elimCon}\,\Gamma)
\end{alignat*}
with the following computation rules.
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \mathsf{elimCon}\,\mathsf{empty} && = empty^M \\
  & \mathsf{elimCon}\,(\mathsf{ext}\,\Gamma\,A) && = ext^M\,(\mathsf{elimCon}\,\Gamma)\,(\mathsf{elimTy}\,A) \\
  & \mathsf{elimTy}\,(\mathsf{U}\,\Gamma) && = U^M\,(\mathsf{elimCon}\,\Gamma) \\
  & \mathsf{elimTy}\,(\mathsf{El}\,\Gamma) && = El^M\,(\mathsf{elimCon}\,\Gamma)
\end{alignat*}

As opposed to mutual inductive types, reducing IITs to inductive types is an
open problem. Forsberg \cite{forsberg-phd} showed a reduction which only
supports a simpler, non-recursive-recursive elimination principle
(\todo{check}). Hugunin \cite{jasper} reduced several IITs to inductive types,
working inside a UIP-free cubical type theory, but he also only constructed the
simpler non-recursive-recursive eliminator.

The theory of signatures in \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} is
a small type theory in which every context encodes a valid quotient
inductive-inductive type (QIIT) signature. For example, the signature
for natural numbers is simply the context
$(Nat:\U,zero:Nat,suc:Nat\ra Nat)$ of length three ($Nat$, $zero$ and
$suc$ are variable names). \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315}
showed that if this theory of signatures exists, then any finitary
QIIT can be defined from it. If we omit the type former $\mathsf{Id}$
from the theory of signatures, we get a theory of finitary IIT
signatures, and the construction of
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} still works: constructing an
arbitrary IIT from the theory of IIT signatures does not need the
$\mathsf{Id}$ type former to be present.

In this paper, we construct the theory of IIT signatures only using
indexed inductive types, thus \todo{rewrite from here}

To derive the existence of all IITs from the theory of IIT signatures
we use a variant of the CwF model
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} where types are modelled not by
displayed CwFs but by CwF isofibrations. We need this extension to
support infinitary constructors. Furthermore, using the method
introduced by Streicher \cite{streichersemantics} we show the
existence of the theory of IIT signatures. As opposed to Streicher, we
don't use quotients in this construction as the theory of IIT
signatures can be given only using neutral terms.

Our metatheory is ETT. Using Hofmann \cite{}, Theo \cite{} translation
we can translate our arguments to ITT+UIP+funext. Section
\ref{sec:ambroise} was formalised in Agda using UIP, rewrite rules and
funext.

This is the paper version of our TYPES 2019 talk.

\subsection{Related Work}

Reduction of classes of inductive types: reduce indexed W-types to
W-types. IR types to indexed types. IITs were introduced by
Forsberg. What he did.  QIITs by Forsberg-lots of people. Our QIIT
paper. Jakob TYPES 2019 abstract.  Jasper Huguin: he didn't do
recursion-recursion. Without UIP.

(Indexed inductive types can be reduced to inductive types using a method
similar to what we use here, preterms and well-formedness predicate.)

Talk about connection to setoidified CwFs (I think these are explained
in some Dybjer paper) and maybe the initiality conjecture.

Kaposi and Kov{\'a}cs defined a type theory of signatures for higher
inductive-inductive types (HIITs)
\cite{kaposi_et_al:LIPIcs:2018:9190}.

Similar techique for other type theories: Streicher
\cite{streichersemantics}. Initiality project, Brunerie \cite{}. These
all use quotients. Closest: Lafont TYPES abstract 2017. Does not use
quotients.

Constructing intrinsic syntax but different techniques: Chapman,
Danielsson, Nuo. These use induction-induction which is our goal.

\subsection{Structure of the Paper}

We first define a \emph{theory of IIT signatures} in which every context is a
valid IIT signature (Section \ref{sec:theory_of_signatures}). We present this
type theory as an algebraic \cite{ttintt} theory, specifically as a quotient
inductive-inductive type (QIIT). In Section \ref{sec:ambroise} we show that this
QIIT can be constructed only using inductive types. In Section
\ref{sec:constructingiits} we describe the construction of IITs from the syntax
of IIT signatures.

\subsection{Metatheory and Notation}

We work in intensional Martin-Löf type theory, equipped with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Predicative universes $\Set_i$. We usually omit level indices in this paper.
  \item Dependent functions, notated as $(x : A)\ra B$, or as $A \ra B$ when
    non-dependent. We sometimes omit function arguments, by implicitly
    generalising over variables.
  \item $\Sigma$-types, notated either as $(x : A)\times B$, or as $\sum\limits_{x} B$
        when we want to leave the type of the first projection implicit. We use $A
        \times B$ for non-dependent pairs.
  \item Intensional propositional equality as $t = u$, with $\refl : t = t$. In
    this paper, we informally use extensional notation, and do not write
    explicit transports over equalities. However, we occasionally indicate by
    $e_1,\dots,e_n \#t$ that $t$ is well-typed thanks to the equalities
    $e_1$,\dots,$e_n$.
  \item Uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP), expressing $(e : t = t)\ra e = \refl$.
  \item Function extensionality, expressing $((x : A) \ra f\,x = g\,x) \ra f = g$.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formalisation}

Agda formalisation of Sections \ref{sec:theory_of_signatures} and
\ref{sec:ambroise} can be found at
\url{https://github.com/amblafont/UniversalII}. In addition to the features in
the previous section, this formalisation also uses equality reflection for some equalities, through rewriting pragmas\cite{cockxsprinkles}. This is purely for convenience, and in principle we could eliminate the instances of equality reflection via UIP and function extensionality.

\section{The Theory of IIT Signatures}
\label{sec:theory_of_signatures}

The theory of IIT signatures is given as an initial category with families
(CwF)\cite{Dybjer96internaltype} with certain additional type formers. The CwF
part constitutes the substitution calculus, while the type formers allow
declaring new sorts and operators in a signature.

\end{alignat*}
\subsubsection{Notation and abbreviations}

We define $\sigma^\uparrow$ as $(\sigma\circ\p,\q)$. In the $\Pi$ function type
for inductive parameters, we have $\app$ as a categorical version of function
application. We recover the usual type-theoretic application as follows:
\begin{alignat*}{5}
  & \blank\oldapp\blank : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\Pi\,a\,B)\ra (u : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,a))
  \ra \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,(B[\id,\,u])) \\
  & t \oldapp u := \app\,t\,[\id\,u]
\end{alignat*}
We also abbreviate non-dependent $\Pi$ functions by writing $\Pi\,a\,(B[p])$ as $a\ra B$.

We can also recover de Bruijn indices by having $n := q[p^n]$, where $p^n$ is
$p$ composed with itself $n$ times. However, for informal examples we instead
use a nameful notation, where we introduce names in context extension and in the
$\Pi$ function domain, for example as $\boldsymbol{\cdot}\,\ext\,A : \U\,\ext\,a :
\El\,A$ in a signature for pointed sets.

\subsubsection{Example signatures}

Natural numbers:
\[
\boldsymbol{\cdot}\,\ext\,N:\U\,\ext\,z : \El\,N\,\ext\,s : N \ra \El\,N
\]
Lists with elements of a given $A : \Set$ type. Here we use the $\Pim$ function
to include an external type into the signature.
\[
\boldsymbol{\cdot}\,\ext\,L:\U\,\ext\,nil : \El\,L\,\ext\,
      cons : \Pim\,A\,(\lambda \_.\, L\ra L)
\]
The inductive-inductive Con-Ty example from Section \ref{sec:intro}:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  & \boldsymbol{\cdot} \,\ext\,Con : \U\,\ext\,Ty : Con\ra\U\,\ext\,empty : \El\,Con\,\ext\,ext : \Pi\,(\Gamma : Con)\,(Ty\oldapp\Gamma \ra Con) \\
  & \hspace{0.5em}\,\ext\, U : \Pi\,(\Gamma:Con)\,(\El\,(Ty\oldapp\Gamma))
    \,\ext\,El : \Pi\,(\Gamma : Con)(\El\,(Ty\oldapp(ext\oldapp\Gamma\oldapp U)))
\end{alignat*}


  %% & \Ty && : \Con\ra\Set \\
  %% & \mathsf{empty} && : \Con \\
  %% & \mathsf{ext} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,\Gamma\ra\Con \\
  %% & \mathsf{U} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,\Con \\
  %% & \mathsf{El} && : (\Gamma:\Con)\ra\Ty\,(\mathsf{ext}\,\Gamma\,(\mathsf{U}\,\Gamma))


\section{Constructing the Theory of IIT Signatures}
\label{sec:ambroise}

\todo{Write this section}

Show that the theory of IIT signatures as described in Section
\ref{sec:theory_of_signatures} exists, that is, it can be defined only
using indexed inductive types and a $\Prop$ sort.

Ambroise has done this in Agda with funext and UIP using an
extrinsic--intrinsic translation.

Ambroise formalisation: \url{https://github.com/amblafont/UniversalII/tree/cwf-syntax/Cwf}.

In this formalization, there is a discrepancy for the typing rule of application
compared to the one of Section~\ref{sec:theory_of_signatures}: it is not
\[
   \app  : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\Pi\,a\,B)\ra\Tm\,(\Gamma\ext \El\,a)\,B
\]
but
\[
   \app  : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\Pi\,a\,B)\ra(u : \Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,a))\ra\,\Tm\,\Gamma\,B[<u>].
\]
Actually, I started with the first version, but at some point I
changed for the second one because it made some stuff easier (although
I don't remember exactly what it was).

I think this should be doable with only UIP (or a $\Prop$-valued
equality type?) and not funext. This would be important for a
computational justification of IITs.

Unfortunately, it seems that funext is needed (see the use of funext in
Syntax.agda) for the metatheoretic/infinitary
parameters part (4-5), for example in the case of the metatheoretic
$ \Pim  : (T:\Set)\ra(T\ra\Ty\,\Gamma)\ra\Ty\,\Gamma $. This needs to be
investigated more carefully.

\section{Constructing IITs from the Theory of IIT Signatures}
\label{sec:constructingiits}

We construct all IITs describable by the theory of IIT signatures through the
term model construction of \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315}. There, it is
shown that from the syntax of the theory of signatures for finitary QIITs, one
can construct any particular finitary QIIT. The idea is that for a signature
$\Gamma$, the initial algebra can be built from sets of terms of the form
$\Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,a)$. For example, considering the signature for natural
numbers
\[
  \Gamma := \boldsymbol{\cdot}\,\ext\,N:\U\,\ext\,z : \El\,N\,\ext\,s : N \ra \El\,N
\]
we have that $\Tm\,\Gamma\,(\El\,N)$ is the set of natural numbers up to isomorphism,
since the only way to construct these terms is by using $s$ and $z$ from $\Gamma$.

In this section, we only need to check that the signatures and term model
construction in \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} restrict to IITs,
i.e.\ that from a syntax for the theory of IIT signatures all finitary IITs are
constructible.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Finitary IIT signatures are obtained exactly by dropping equality constructors from
  finitary QIIT signatures. It follows that any model for the theory of QIIT signatures
  restricts to IITs, hence we inherit the categorical semantics of QIITs.
\item
  The term model construction also restricts in a straightforward way. For QIITs,
  term algebras are constructed by induction on the syntax of signatures, and
  then another induction constructs the eliminator (i.e.\ dependent induction
  principle). In both cases, simply dropping equality constructors from the
  induction yields restriction to IITs.
\end{enumerate}

However, we shall mention that the Agda formalisation for the current paper
cannot be directly plugged into the Agda code for
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} (which includes most of the term model
construction). One reason is that the QIIT formalisation uses strict computation
rules for induction over signatures, while here we show propositional
computation. This mismatch can be in principle remedied by noting that both
formalisations use UIP and function extensionality, hence we can switch between
strict and propositional equalities, via the known translations between
extensional and intensional type
theories\cite{hofmann95extensional,winterhalter2019eliminating}.

Also, the current paper proves initiality, i.e.\ unique recursion for
signatures, while \cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} uses dependent
elimination. We expect that the two notions are equivalent. An extension of
\cite{Kaposi:2019:CQI:3302515.3290315} to large infinitary QIITs would entail
this equivalence, since that would cover the (large, infinitary) theory of IIT
signatures.


\section{Further Work}

The current work only concerns finitary IITs. An extension would be to also
allow infinitely branching inductive types such as W-types. This would first
require giving semantics for infinitary IITs (to our knowledge there is no
previously published semantics that we can borrow), and also giving a term model
construction analogously to finitary QIITs. These steps seem feasible. However,
it seems to be more difficult to construct the syntax of infinitary IIT
signatures without using quotients. The reason is that such syntax would not be
strictly restricted to neutral terms: we would need $\lambda$-abstraction and
$\beta\eta$-rules for infinitary $\Pi$ types, in order to allow a term model
construction for infinitary IITs. A definition of normal preterms and typing
judgments on them may still be possible, but it appears to be much more
complicated than before (the current authors have attempted this without
conclusive success).

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:right_uniqueness}, it also remains an open
problem whether IITs are reducible to inductive types in a UIP-free setting. To
show this, we would need to construct the syntax of signatures without UIP, and
also reproduce the semantics and term model construction for IITs without UIP.
