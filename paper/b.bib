In extensional type theory, inductive-inductive types can be constructed from inductive types, and this construction has been conjectured to work in intensional type theory as well. In this paper, we show that the existing construction requires Uniqueness of Identity Proofs, and present a new construction (which we conjecture generalizes) of one particular inductive-inductive type in cubical type theory, which is compatible with homotopy type theory.",

abstract="The term UniMath refers both to a formal system for mathematics, as well as a computer-checked library of mathematics formalized in that system. The UniMath system is a core dependent type theory, augmented by the univalence axiom. The system is kept as small as possible in order to ease verification of it---in particular, general inductive types are not part of the system. In this work, we partially remedy the lack of inductive types by constructing some set-level datatypes and their associated induction principles from other type constructors. This involves a formalization of a category-theoretic result on the construction of initial algebras, as well as a mechanism to conveniently use the datatypes obtained. We also connect this construction to a previous formalization of substitution for languages with variable binding. Altogether, we construct a framework that allows us to concisely specify, via a simple notion of binding signature, a language with variable binding. From such a specification we obtain the datatype of terms of that language, equipped with a certified monadic substitution operation and a suitable recursion scheme. Using this we formalize the untyped lambda calculus and the raw syntax of Martin-L{\"o}f type theory.",

abstract="Higher inductive types (HITs) in Homotopy Type Theory allow the definition of datatypes which have constructors for equalities over the defined type. HITs generalise quotient types, and allow to define types with non-trivial higher equality types, such as spheres, suspensions and the torus. However, there are also interesting uses of HITs to define types satisfying uniqueness of equality proofs, such as the Cauchy reals, the partiality monad, and the well-typed syntax of type theory. In each of these examples we define several types that depend on each other mutually, i.e. they are inductive-inductive definitions. We call those HITs quotient inductive-inductive types (QIITs). Although there has been recent progress on a general theory of HITs, there is not yet a theoretical foundation for the combination of equality constructors and induction-induction, despite many interesting applications. In the present paper we present a first step towards a semantic definition of QIITs. In particular, we give an initial-algebra semantics. We further derive a section induction principle, stating that every algebra morphism into the algebra in question has a section, which is close to the intuitively expected elimination rules.",
