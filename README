Works with Agda 2.6.0.1
In this directory, the model has full substitutions and the recursor construct them

Files (in the order of dependancy)


1. Lib : some useful lemmas, some of them requiring UIP
   EqLib : definitions and lemmas taking from the HoTT library (without uip)
2. Syntax : the syntax
2. ModelRew : postulated model with rewrite rules
3. Relation : Relation between the syntax and the postulated model
4. RelationWeakening : this relation is preserved by lifting/weakening
5. RelationSubstitution : this relation is preserved by full substitutions
6. RelationInhabit : construction of a witness of the relation

Model: model, as a record

SyntaxIsInitial: initality of the morphism (existence, uniqueness)

TODO: actuellement,  Pi A B [s] = Pi A[s] B[s ^ A]
      ç remplacer par Pi A[s] B[s o wk] pour que Pi[] soit definitionnel

      rendre _$_ primitif plutôt que app. Peut etre cela rendrait app[] plus definitionel dans le model
      -- pas sur de cette dernière idée...

DO i use the fact that the morphism preserve composition when showing uniqueness ?
Probably, but if not, can I show it ?

TODO remove subT (replace by < _ >, but it is not that straightforward as <_> needs to know the length of the context, whereas subT does not)

TODO remove useless typeclass instances (most of them are ignored by the new version of Agda)
